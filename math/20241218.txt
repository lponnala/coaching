## TEST 2

[1] (from 5.5)
Does this equation have no solution, one solution, or infinitely many solutions?
(1/3)(9x + 5) = 3x + 5/3

infinitely many solutions (same line)

[2] (from 5.5)
Solve this equation:
|3x + 5| = |-3x - 1|

6x = -6 => x = -1
no solution

[3] (from 5.6)
A student takes 4 minutes to solve a math problem, and 3 minutes to
answer a science question. In 35 minutes, can the student solve
6 math problems and answer 3 science questions?

Yes

[4] (from 5.6)
Graph this inequality:
y > -2x -4

area above the line connecting points (0,-4) and (-2,0)

[5] (from 5.6)
Write an inequality that represents this graph:
[exercise 38]

y <= 3x - 3

[6] (from 5.6)
Draw the region represented by the following information:
* The points (2,5) and (-3,-5) lie on the boundary line.
* The points (6,5) and (-2,-3) are solutions of the inequality.

[7] (from 5.7)
Is the ordered pair (4,-3) a solution of this system of inequalities:
y <= -x + 1
y <= 5x - 2

Yes

[8] (from 5.7)
Write a system of linear inequalities represented by this graph:
[exercise 23]

y >= (2/3)x - 2
y >= -3x + 2
